* This will be a javascript application that will fetch movie data from an api, namely omdbapi.com.
* Will use axios for fetching data from outside sources.
* For some of the styling I will be using the Bulma framework as well as custom css.
* The app will have a search function that should include autocomplete.
* Establish search and autocomplete criteria along with rules associated therewith.
* The app will display a poster of the movie along with any search parameters.
* Build the autocomplete widget from scratch
